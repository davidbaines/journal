I'm learning about AI and NLP.
I plan to post some information here that helped me to set up my own machine. So often I've found a solution to a problem and immediately moved on to the next problem. Then when I come across the same problem months later I can't remember how I solved it. Instead I would like to slow down a bit and record the solutions I've found. Since it's easy enough to publish those I might as well. Maybe someone else is looking for the same solution.

Peace.
David.
