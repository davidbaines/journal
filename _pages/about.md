I'm learning about AI and NLP.
I plan to post some information here that helped me to set up my own machine. I've found a solution to a problem and immediately moved on to the next problem. When I come across the same problem, months later, I can't remember how I solved it. Instead of repeating that scenario, I'd like to slow down a bit, record the solutions I've found, maybe that would help me understand more so that I don't need to 'remember'.  Maybe the solutions will help someone else too.

Peace.
David.
